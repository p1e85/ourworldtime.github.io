        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><em>Last Updated: September 21, 2025</em></p>
        
        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
            By accessing and using Our World Time (the "Website"), you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and provision of this agreement. If you do not agree to abide by these terms, please do not use this Website.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>
            Our World Time is a real-time world clock and time zone converter. Use the interactive dial to find the current local time in cities from around the globe, perfect for scheduling international meetings or keeping in touch with friends and family abroad. The Website offers a free version with core functionality and an optional "Pro Version" with enhanced features.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Payments, Refunds, and Pro Version</h2>
        <p>
            To unlock the Pro Version, you must make a one-time donation of the amount specified on the Website (e.g., $1.49 USD). This is a voluntary donation to support the project.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>All donations are final and non-refundable.</strong> Upon a successful donation, the Pro Version features will be unlocked for the browser you used to make the payment. You will also be provided with a backup code via the on-screen confirmation. It is your responsibility to save this code. This code can be used to restore Pro access if you clear your browser data or switch to a new device.
        </p>
